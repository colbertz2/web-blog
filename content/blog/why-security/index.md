So I want to work in cybersecurity. I worked as a help desk tech for 3 1/2 years during my undergrad, where I majored in physics. Why do I want to work in security? I'm not sure I've actually been able to answer that question, but I got some nice insight today.

If you asked me why I don't carry on with physics, THAT I can tell you. (It doesn't bear going into right now). But why security specifically? Why not stick with help desk for a while, or work toward systems admin or network engineer?

As I've been applying for jobs in the tech sector for the last few months, I have come to realize that I don't have the skills yet to be competitive for security roles. I can see that help desk, system admin, network engineering are all good steps for me.

But I don't want to stop there. Security is the goal.

I would articulate my motivation before today something like "Well, security is important. There's some super cool stuff happening in the field. And I feel like I'm smart enough to do the job." None of that is untrue, but I know that it's not a _good_ reason. And it doesn't really articulate my motivation very well either.

So I spotted this today:

> "Even with computer security an established profession built on training courses and certifications, Chien favored job candidates who had no experience but had an unquenchable curiosity and a nagging need to solve puzzles and tear things apart.
> It was easy to teach someone how to code virus signatures, but you couldn't teach curiosity or instill in someone a passion for knowing how things worked.
> The best researchers had an obsessive streak that made them dog a piece of code until it relinquished its secrets."
>
> &mdash; Kim Zetter, _Countdown to Zero Day_

I read that and went, "Yeah, that's it!"

"I'm obsessive!" (kidding a little bit)

Actually though, this is why I'm so fascinated with security. This is why I was so fascinated with physics for a while. This is part of why I loved working a help desk for 3+ years.

I love picking up a new problem, and turning it inside out.

The complex web of technologies that the world runs on today is full of <br/>:sparkles:glorious:sparkles: problems. I want to work in security because I will never run out of systems / networks / software / etc to pull apart.

I want to know how it all works, and solve some problems in the process.
