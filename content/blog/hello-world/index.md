Anyone who has attempted to learn a new programming language knows that we start with "Hello World!" Aside from the fact that the template for this blog starts out with a post entitled "Hello World" and I've only added the exclamation mark, it seems appropriate.

## About the Author

Nearly three months ago I graduated from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Physics, minoring in Computer Science. When I started my degree program in 2015 the idea was to go on to a graduate program in physics and do cutting-edge research (ideally with lasers). I was able to work with so many intelligent and helpful people in the department, loved what I was learning, and enjoyed most[^1] of my classes. But as I tried to dive into modern experimental physics and the deadlines for my thesis&mdash;a physics major requirement&mdash;loomed large, even the lasers weren't enough to keep me engaged. I felt like I didn't know enough to even talk about the fundamentals of my field; my research in solid-state physics felt less than unremarkable, and it was hard to watch my graduate student colleagues do the remarkable research they are known for. I felt as though even if I tried, I could never sort out my next steps.

Near the end of my fourth year, after missing several deadlines for thesis revisions, I decided that I needed to stay through another year to finish my writing. I also decided to add a computer science minor to fill time. I had already been working as an IT technician for nearly three years at the time, and have always had a strong interest in computers.

I was able to submit a [thesis](https://www.zcolbert.com/zc-thesis.pdf) at the end of my fifth year; not everything I had hoped for, but it was enough to graduate with. I had a lot of freedom to choose courses for my computer science minor, and I had a blast during that last year. Intro to Cryptography was a particularly great course. The instructor was knowledgeable, fun, and engaging; the content was this fascinating fusion of math, algorithms, and attacks on algorithms; and crypto has been a passing interest in recent years. It was this fifth year that changed my whole outlook, and gave me a vision of the future that I had lost in the physics department.

Today, I'm trying to start a career in cybersecurity[^2]. It's been quite a challenge pivoting from physics into a technical field in which I have _some_ experience, but seldom check all the boxes on an entry-level job posting. The pandemic hasn't made things easy either, but I will admit that I should have started my search much sooner than I did. In the meantime, I'm studying lots of fun security and general tech topics.

## About the Blog

Part of the motivation for this blog is to have it as a study tool. It will serve as an exercise for myself&mdash;explaining the topics that I'm working through myself&mdash;and a resource to come back to later.

The Internet has facilitated unprecedented information sharing in recent decades. Drawing inspiration from the open-source/-data/-information movements and countless hours desperately Googling for readable documentation, I hope that someone can get useful information out of me once in a while.

Enjoy!
