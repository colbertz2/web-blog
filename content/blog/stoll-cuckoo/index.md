Having just graduated from university and walked into the _real world_ in the middle of a pandemic, there are basically five things I do on any given day: apply for jobs, cook, wash dishes, read about computer crap, and write code. I'll do a little writeup soon for the code I'm currently working on. Today I'm focused on reading.

Did you know that before Twitter and blogs, keyboard jockeys wrote **_books_**? Like, actual paper books! What a fascinating world we live in. (I'm actually curious now about short-form tech writing of the 80s... were there magazines? Scientific journals? Did people just write really long forum posts?)

So in trying to find research topics &mdash; and in trying not to get all of my tech reading from Twitter &mdash; I've been checking out books that are significant in the IT/cybersecurity space. One that stood out early to me was Cliff Stoll's _The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage_. Somebody shared [this great Wired article about Cliff][1], which led me to [his website][2] featuring one-sided bottles &mdash; and that title! How could I not? I found a used copy at a local bookstore for \$4.20 (not a joke) and got started within a day after hearing about this book for the first time.

Cliff (would he want me to call him by his first name?) has a very casual writing style that worked well for the story. He's just a guy, kind of out of his element, hacking away at an unimportant problem until it develops into an international rabbit hole. We get just enough of the technical detail to keep me engaged, but not so much that any reader would feel alienated. The story itself is just as thrilling as the canon of security techniques that Cliff introduces along the way. Reading hasn't been one of my leisure activities for years, but _The Cuckoo's Egg_ was hard to put down once I got started.

I think _The Cuckoo's Egg_ was a really great start in my search for books about technology. It was a lot of fun to read, but it also had me asking questions about networks and \*nix systems that I didn't know I needed to ask. I found myself reading with a pen and paper next to me so I could write down questions for later Googling and references to the text. It inspired me to write [a post][3] about a pretty basic command-line tool that I had never heard of (and a bunch of others that I had fun with). A week after finishing the book, I still have a small stack of research topics that this one story generated for me.

Because my summary will never do it justice, just read the book. If you're a computer person, you'll get a fun glimpse into the weird networks of the late 80s. If you're not, you'll get a great story about how \$0.75 went missing and a guy from Berkeley showed the world just how fragile and vulnerable their computers were.
